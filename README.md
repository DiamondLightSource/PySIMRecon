# PySIMRecon

A simple tool to reconstruct SIM data and and process OTFs from Microscope-Cockpit's DV files with pyCUDAsirecon from DLS B24's cryoSIM

### Goal

To reconstruct the SIM data and create OTFs from PSFs from the cryoSIM at B24, Diamond from the .dv files created by Cockpit. Requirements are:

- Easy to use
- Open source
- Reproducable results
- Can be used as part of an automatic processing pipeline

### Current state

Under development
