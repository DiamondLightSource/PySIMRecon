# PySIMRecon

Easy to use wrapper for pyCUDAsirecon, allowing the use of DV (DeltaVision) files without IVE/Priism (UCSF library with MRC/DV support).

This is built for easy use from the command line or as part of an auto-processing pipeline, allowing parameters to be pre-configured or defined at runtime.

### Goal

To reconstruct the SIM data and create OTFs from PSFs from the cryoSIM at B24, Diamond from the .dv files created by Cockpit. Requirements are:

- Easy to use
- Open source
- Reproducible results
- Can be used as part of an automatic processing pipeline
